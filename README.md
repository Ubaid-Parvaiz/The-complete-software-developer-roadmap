# Step2:Pickup a programming language: 15-20 days

I would suggest to pick up JavaScript.since it's so flexible and you can do a lot in it.

# Step:3 Learn a framework and start building projects 10-15 days

If you wanna learn frontend I would suggest looking at react.
React comes up with a good documentation and best place to probably learn react in on its own website.
It comes with good tutorials and concepts are explained really well!

# Step 4:Learn some backend knowledge: 15 - 20 days

I would suggest node.js,since if you have learned javascript you don't need to worry about it too much.It will be really easy for you.

You can also take a look at its docs.It's really good


# Step5:Learn about REST API: 1 week

At this time you should be able to land jobs or contracts.But you do need to know about api as a developer you will be working on consuming a lot of API'S


Now you should be ready and can call yourself a Fullstack developer.You can get a job now and land clients if you want.



# How to learn quickly - no.1 secret

The no1 reason why people get stuck while learning is trying to finish every course on internet while not playing with language itself.
I did this too.This is more known as tutorial purgotary.You can learn about it on YouTube.There are a ton of vedios on it.

So what do you?Suppose you are picking up JavaScript.Don't go and start a course see what the guy builds on ciurse and copy that,NO don't do that.It's really silly You learn nothing from it.Instead you are just stuck in an endless loop.
What you do is look at the docs and pick up a course.Google the most important that a biggeners needs to learn.Read about those concepts on docs.Play with the concepts and then try to build something of your own.Don't just copy and paste.
You will fall into a lot of problems but that's where the fun begins.

As promised I'm going to give you the most popular book on html.It's up on the top you could clone or download this repository and get that.
Also if you liked this plan I gave you.Star this project and share it,and if you don't agree with what I said still star and share it :)
